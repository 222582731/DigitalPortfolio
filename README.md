Reflection:

1. Situation:
   * During my first year of university, I was not sure about which career path should I take. Although I was studying Information and Communication Technology, I felt equally drawn to both software development and Data Sciences. I needed to decide which field aligned better with my skills, interests, and long-term goals.
  
2. Task:
   * I needed to make an informed career decision that would not just be about the availability of job, but about what I would actually enjoyi doing and continuosly add value.
  
3. Action:
   * I applied the STAR technique by listing the projects I have worked on both group and individual, reflected on web development projects, and the Data Analytics projects I had. And I realized that I actually enjoy developing websites.
  
4. Result:
   * This technique helped me in discovering which path I enjoy the most, and I am now working towards becoming one of the best web developers as I have decided to join the FNB App academy, which I beileve will have an input in upgrading my skill.
